I need you to help me translate English game messages to Hebrew for a King's Quest II Hebrew localization project. 

**Task:** Add Hebrew translations to CSV files containing game messages.

**File Format:**
- Each CSV file has 4 columns: logic_number,message_id,"english_text",hebrew_translation
- Column 3 contains English text that needs to be translated
- Column 4 (currently empty) should be filled with Hebrew translation
- Important: sometimes a message contains a comma in it - in this case there will be quotes surround the message.
- Each csv file has 100 lines
- Keep the CSV structure intact

**Translation Guidelines:**
1. Translate the English text in column 3 to Hebrew for column 4
2. This is for a fantasy adventure game (King's Quest II), so maintain appropriate tone
3. Preserve any special formatting, quotation marks, or punctuation within the text
4. For game-specific terms (like character names, place names), use appropriate Hebrew transliterations
5. Keep the translation natural and appropriate for Hebrew speakers. For example prefer a sentence like אין כאן גמד than a sentence like אין גמד כאן.
6. When translating, consider that this is a text adventure game from the 1980s

**IMPORTANT SPECIAL HANDLING:**
- **Variables (%w1, %w2, %w3):** If you see %w1, %w2, or %w3 in the text, leave them EXACTLY as they are (don't change the order of letters) but place them in the appropriate position within the Hebrew sentence structure.
- **Quotation marks ("):** If you see " characters in the text, leave them exactly as they are in the same position within the Hebrew sentence.

**Current File:** output/messages_split/messages_part1.csv (100 rows)
**Next Files:** output/messages_split/messages_part2.csv through messages_part8.csv (I'll provide them sequentially)

**Example of what I need:**
Input row: `0,1,"You splash around in the water for a while but seem to have forgotten how to swim. Unfortunately, you drown.",,`
Output row: `0,1,"You splash around in the water for a while but seem to have forgotten how to swim. Unfortunately, you drown.","אתה מתיז במים לזמן מה אבל נראה ששכחת איך לשחות. למרבה הצער, אתה טובע.",`

Please translate all the English messages in folder output/messages_split
